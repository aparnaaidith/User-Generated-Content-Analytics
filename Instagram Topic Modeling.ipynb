    "Task B (What can you conclude from the analysis?) & Task D:\n",
    "Base on our analysis in part B, both image labels and post caption words have significant impacts on the engagement score the posts. We recommend National Geographic to post photos an,d write caption words according to the high-impact words we captured in Part B. For example, we found that “river” and “sunlight” are two features positively correlated to the engagement score, so national geographic should post more pictures about “river” and “sunlight” and mention these keywords in the captions to increase the engagement of its Instagram page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Base on our analysis in part C, we recommend National Geographic to include the engagement-inducing objects in the posts when they post pictures in the relevant topics. For example, in the “Great Day” topic, the engagement-inducing objects include “sky”, “atmosphere”, “cloud”, “area”, and “dog”. So National Geographic should include these objects when they post pictures regard to the “Great Day” topic. Additionally, by performing the marginal topic distribution analysis, we were able to identify that five is the optimal number of topics for the LDA model.\n",

'i can show you the path but you have to walk the path', that’s what the buddha said. when you practice meditation, you can see yourself.\\n\\ngreed, hatred and ignorance are the three root causes of all these crazy things that we do. free yourself, find your own peace. that’s the central message that buddha gave. there are a lot of things that we are doing habitually and so what he was encouraging is don’t live habitually, live mindfully. when you are mindfully living, you are concentrated about other people. life is like a bubble of water…like a dew drop which is hanging on the tip of a leaf. any time it’s fragile, any time it can drop off. so therefore, uncertainty is always there so don’t leave any room for regret, do nice things. do things that you can be happy [about] so that you are always prepared. what buddha said was ‘may all beings be well and happy.’ that’s all. you can practice it. practice it like a mother who has only one child. she will be risking her life to save her only child. so we must have that quality within us. use that same kind of love to all beings.”\",\n",
