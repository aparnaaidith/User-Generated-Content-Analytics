## What is web-scraping?
Web scraping is a technique for extracting information from the internet automatically using a software that simulates human web surfing.

Web scraping helps us extract large volumes of data about customers, products, people, stock markets, etc. It is usually difficult to get this kind of information on a large scale using traditional data collection methods. We can utilize the data collected from a website such as e-commerce portal, social media channels to understand customer behaviors and sentiments, buying patterns, and brand attribute associations which are critical insights for any business.

## Requirements :
* Python 3.0
* Selenium package
* Chrome driver
